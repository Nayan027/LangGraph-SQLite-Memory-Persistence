InMemorySaver() for persistent memory, but stores in RAM - volatile memory:
    everything is lost either on switching application off or even on refreshing the app.

Thus, need DataBase so that even after days if application is turned on - memory has previous data to 
retrieve old conversations.

SqliteSaver() - expects a connection object which is provided by sqlite3.

------------------------- CHANGES MADE COMPARED TO RAM-MEMORY-PERSISTENCE-STRATEGY -----------------------------------

* Backend:
1. checkpointer uses SqliteSaver instead of InMemorySaver

2. a function created to retrieve a list of all unique thread_ids from the database


* Frontend:
1. use the funcn. created in backend in place of an empty list - as it expects a list and the function 
   returns a list of thread-ids.

Install SQLite viewer in VS-Code to visualize DataBase storage of checkpointers and other stuff such as metadata.
